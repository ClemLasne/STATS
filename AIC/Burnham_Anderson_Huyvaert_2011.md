*Super interesting paper about the advantages of the **information theory** approach over the tradition statistical tests such as anova and the p-value approach.*

Some key points:

## Introduction
> The standard practice so far has been to define a single alternative hypothesis and to test it against a null hypothesis. An alternative is think of several plausible alternative hypotheses (models) and to evaluate the relative **strenght of evidence** for each hypothesised model.

**TRADITIONAL METHODS**
> Traditional methods have focused on *testing* null hypotheses based on test statistics and their associated *P* values. From *P* values comes an arbitrary judgment concerning "statistical significance" and dichotomous ruling about the **rejection of, or failure to reject, the null hypothesis**. Fore several reasons, *P* values do not consistute a basis for formal evidence. (see Royall 1997)

**INFORMATION THEORY (I-T)**
> The I-T methods provide a formal fundamentally sound appraoch of developping an *a priori* set of hypotheses and then a quantification of the data-based evidence for, and ranking of each hypothesis. This is followed by **interpretation** of the result in the face of model selection uncertainty, one aspect of **multimodel inference**. 

## Fundamentals
> What we want is a model from within a model set that loses the least information about full reality, hence, the model hat is the closest to full reality in the current set. The **best model** is *NOT* the model that "best fits the data" but rather the model that **"minimizes the loss of information"** about the dataset. This model has the smallest AIC score.

**AIC**

*find another ref for that* but it uses log-likelyhood (LL) .

**Delta AIC**
Î”<sub>i</sub> = AIC<sub>c*i*</sub> - AIC<sub>c*min*</sub>
