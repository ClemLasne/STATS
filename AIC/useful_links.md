# what is AIC used for ?

In statistics, AIC is most often used **for model selection**. By calculating and comparing the AIC scores of several possible models, you can choose the one that is the best fit for the data. [...] You want to know which of the independent variables you have measured explain the variation in your dependent variable. [...] Once youâ€™ve created several possible models, you can use AIC to compare them. **Lower AIC scores are better**, and AIC penalizes models that use more parameters. So if two models explain the same amount of variation, **the one with fewer parameters will have a lower AIC score and will be the better-fit model.**
